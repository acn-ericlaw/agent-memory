- [ ] **(backlog) Before-session presence for Cursor/Kiro — path-scoped steering imports.** From a
  maintainer question after v4.29.0 shipped ("what about other vendors' entry points?"). v4.29.0
  covered the only two entry files with native import syntax (`CLAUDE.md` `@path`, `GEMINI.md`
  `@./path.md`); AGENTS.md-native runtimes (Codex, Kiro, Antigravity) auto-load the one-line shim —
  only the `AGENTS.md → memory/PROTOCOL.md` hop stays voluntary; Copilot/`.cursorrules`/`.windsurfrules` have
  no import mechanism (the v4.20.1 front-load pattern is the one inline lever — small stable
  snippets only, never protocol copies). **Two real levers exist, blocked by our own `.gitignore`
  stance, not the vendors:** Cursor modern rules (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) attach files via
  `@`-references; Kiro steering (`.kiro/steering/*.md`) supports `#[[file:…]]` inclusion. Both dirs
  are gitignored-personal wholesale today; adopting needs a **path-scoped carve-out** (the
  `.github/skills/`-inside-tracked-`.github/` pattern) + a committed steering file per vendor.
  **Don't build speculatively** — trigger is a Cursor or Kiro team reporting the context-read
  failure class (complaints = adoption signal). → serves: vision-agent-memory
