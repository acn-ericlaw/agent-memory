# Continuity — agent-memory

> Shared ground truth for this tool's own development state.

## Project State

- **project:** agent-memory
- **status:** v4.27.0 — a vendor-neutral, no-code (markdown) shared-AI-memory + AI-enablement tool. Three shared layers: **backward memory** (v3.x — fact metadata + ids, decay/review/archive), a **forward VBDI cognitive loop** (v4.0 — Vision→Blueprint→Design→Impl over the memory substrate), and a **cross-vendor skills layer** (v4.1+ — neutral committed `agent-skills/` + a runnable `sync-adapters`; six adapter targets: Claude/Gemini/Cursor/Kiro/Copilot/Antigravity). Agent-as-runtime; `memory/` is committed + shared. Built-in skills: `memory-lint`, `second-opinion`+`apply-critique`, `sync-adapters`, `harvest-knowledge`, `archive-fact`, `refresh-metadata`. Vendor-neutral ritual triggers (committed git hook + CI floor) with first-run self-init; Windows LF hardening. **Per-version history lives in `UPGRADE.md` (the version ladder) + `memory/sessions/` — kept OUT of this line by design (v4.22.0): `status` is a short current-state descriptor, not a changelog, so this shared line doesn't become a merge-conflict hotspot.** `.agent/version.md` is the canonical version. Validated across six vendors (Claude, Gemini, Cursor, Kiro, Copilot CLI, Antigravity).
- **last_enabled:** 2026-06-12
- **last_session:** 2026-06-29 | agent: Claude Code (2026-06-29-175644)
- **last_review:** 2026-06-28 | through 2026-06-28-162543
- **last_invariant_check:** 2026-06-27 | through 2026-06-27-215825
- **vision:** `memory/vision.md` (north star; Blueprint gaps in Open Threads below)

## What's Been Built

**Core protocol & templates**
- `ENABLE.md` — 10-step protocol: detection (Step 2), mode selection (Step 3),
  analysis (4), generate/complete (5), bootstrap install (6), `.gitignore` install
  (7), verify (8), report (9), post-enable actions (10); version-aware Mode B
- `MIGRATE.md` — per-vendor migration protocols for 11 vendors (reached via Mode C)
- `AGENTS.md` — dual-mode dispatch (memory protocol + enable)
- `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, Copilot bootstrap
- `templates/` — bootstrap + memory templates with `{{placeholders}}`, including
  `templates/.gitignore` (v3.1.0), `memory/decay-policy.md`, `.agent/version.md`
- `memory/` — this tool's own memory layer (dogfooded)

**Evolving-memory layer (v3.0.0)**
- `DECAY.md` (deterministic integer tier rules), `REVIEW.md` (review ritual),
  `UPGRADE.md` (in-place version ladder, operator-only), `VERSION` (semver)
- `docs/DESIGN-evolving-memory.md` (design) + `docs/assessments/` (industry-alignment baseline)
- `memory/archive/` cold storage; fact metadata footers + `## Memory References`

**v3.1.0**
- AI-infrastructure `.gitignore` propagation into enabled repos (create-or-append,
  de-duplicating, add-only)

**Governance / licensing**
- `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0), `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog; v1.0.0–3.1.0)

**Examples**
- `examples/rust-event-bus/` — Mode A, a REAL fixture (unedited output from enabling
  `~/sandbox/rust/rust_event_bus_example`); replaced the old node-project mock
- `examples/migrated-cursor-aider-project/` — Mode C (Cursor + Aider, originals under
  `legacy/`, 3 converted sessions)
- `examples/evolving-memory-example/` — the review ritual in action (continuity
  before/after, archive, session log with Memory References)

## Supported Migration Sources (v2)

Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Roo Code, Aider, Continue.dev, Codeium/Windsurf,
GitHub Copilot, GPT/Codex agents, Zed AI, Gemini CLI.

## Architectural Invariants

> Hard constraints — the tool's core safety philosophy. These never decay (`core`).
> (Added 2026-06-13 when this repo adopted the evolving-memory layer.)
>
> Each invariant's `(ADR-NNNN)` tag points to its full Architecture Decision Record in
> `docs/arch-decisions/ADR.md` (rationale + trade-offs) — a **pointer for humans**. The invariant text here
> is authoritative for the agent; **don't open `docs/arch-decisions/ADR.md` to orient** — read it on demand only.

- Target-repo scope only (ADR-0001) — never read/modify/move anything outside the resolved
  target-repo root (never `~`, `~/.claude/`, Application Support, AppData, system paths)
  <!-- id: target-repo-scope-only | created: 2026-06-13 | last_used: 2026-06-18 | uses: 12 | tier: core -->
- Never delete vendor files (ADR-0002) — move originals to `legacy/<vendor>/`, preserving paths
  <!-- id: never-delete-vendor-files | created: 2026-06-13 | last_used: 2026-06-18 | uses: 8 | tier: core -->
- Never overwrite, never pick a winner (ADR-0003) — fold vendor steering under
  `## Migrated rules from <vendor>`; surface contradictions as Open Threads
  <!-- id: never-pick-a-winner | created: 2026-06-13 | last_used: 2026-06-18 | uses: 14 | tier: core -->
- No build step; agent-run (ADR-0006) — the tool itself runs no code and needs none (no install, no
  daemon). The markdown files are the product and the agent is the runtime. A skill MAY
  bundle optional helper scripts, but those are invoked by the agent/vendor at the user's
  direction, never executed by the tool.
  <!-- id: no-build-step-agent-run | created: 2026-06-16 | last_used: 2026-06-20 | uses: 31 | tier: core | supersedes: no-code-markdown-only | origin: 2026-06-16-002134 -->
- Upgrades are additive and non-destructive (ADR-0005) — enrich and add, never rewrite or delete —
  **except the tool's own managed built-ins** (`memory-lint`, `second-opinion`, `apply-critique`,
  `sync-adapters`, `harvest-knowledge`, `archive-fact`, `refresh-metadata`), which are re-copied (overwritten) on upgrade; that overwrite is scoped to those tool-owned files,
  and a user customizes only by forking under a new skill name (see `ENABLE.md` §5i). For everything
  the user authors, the invariant holds unchanged.
  <!-- id: upgrades-additive | created: 2026-06-13 | last_used: 2026-06-20 | uses: 22 | tier: core -->

## Key Decisions

- Originals preserved under `legacy/<vendor>/`, never deleted
- Steering content folded into `memory/instructions.md` as
  `## Migrated rules from <vendor>` sections
- History (JSONL, markdown chat logs, JSON sessions) converted to dated
  `memory/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md` files (one per session; filename =
  persist time UTC; title = `# Session (startZ - endZ)` with full ISO 8601 ms;
  lexicographic sort = chronological sort, resolves last-session unambiguously
  across multiple contributors)
- Contradictions between vendors surface as Open Threads — the tool never picks a winner
- Three modes: Fresh Enable (A), Already Ours (B, idempotent), Migrate Vendor (C)
- Dry-run support so users can preview before committing

## Open Threads

- [x] **Shipped v4.27.0 (MINOR) — standardized PR descriptions: lead with What / Why.** From a **maintainer
  suggestion** to standardize the look-and-feel of pull-request descriptions and **propagate it to every
  AI-enabled repo**. A natural fit — *why* is already a first-class artifact throughout the protocol (VBDI
  intent trace, ADR rationale, supersession reasons, the changelog's own `> summary + Why` shape), and the
  content projects from the session log(s) in the PR (What from the change, Why from the Blueprint gap /
  decision). Confirmed **no prior PR guidance existed** (only the commit `Co-Authored-By` trailer) — a real
  gap. **Shape:** two sections, **What** + **Why** (substantive intent, not a restatement of What), each 1–2
  short paragraphs (flexible, not rigidly two), closing with a self-identifying `Co-Authored-By:` footer
  (extends the commit/session-log authorship convention to the PR altitude); **advisory, never a gate**
  (`guide-don't-prescribe`). **Built**
  `.github/pull_request_template.md` (this repo + `templates/`, so enabled repos inherit it) + an `AGENTS.md`
  convention (root + template) as the **vendor-neutral backstop** (the template only covers GitHub web UI /
  `gh pr create`; the steering line covers agents composing a PR body) + a checklist line. Lockstep:
  `ENABLE.md` Step 6 (install template), `VERSION`→4.27.0, `CHANGELOG`, `README` (row + file tree), `UPGRADE`
  (row + rung), docs site (`getting-started`). No memory-file shape change. → serves: vision-agent-memory
  (faithful, traceable delivery — intent is carried at the PR altitude too, across vendors)

- [x] **Shipped v4.26.1 (PATCH) — `[stale-metadata]` / `refresh-metadata` no longer opine on a pinned
  thread's tier.** From a **mercury sanity check** (post-Copilot review): v4.26.0 flagged every
  `working`-tagged pinned `- [ ]` open thread as "should be `active`" — noise, since a pinned thread never
  decays *regardless* of its tier label (its **pinned-ness** protects it, not the label). Refinement: both
  `expected_tier`s (memory-lint check 9 + refresh-metadata) now return a pinned thread's **stored** tier — no
  flag, no rewrite — while still refreshing its factual `uses`/`last_used`. Surfaced by the comparison of
  `refresh-metadata` vs Copilot's `update-metadata.py` (which *skipped* pinned threads; this lands on the same
  outcome by a cleaner rule, and `refresh-metadata` is otherwise a strict, safer superset — preserves all
  footer fields, reads `decay-policy.md`, clamps at archive-candidate). The same sanity check confirmed
  **no data loss** on mercury (it never used `supersedes`/`superseded-by`/`formalizes` footer fields) and a
  **correct archival**. Lockstep: memory-lint + refresh-metadata scripts + tests (memory-lint 34), `DECAY.md`
  rule 4, both SKILL.md notes, `VERSION`→4.26.1, `CHANGELOG`, `README`, `UPGRADE` (row + rung). Descriptions
  unchanged → adapters untouched. → serves: vision-agent-memory (the advisory stays signal, not noise)
  <!-- id: pinned-tier-refinement-v4261 | created: 2026-06-28 | last_used: 2026-06-28 | uses: 1 | tier: working | origin: 2026-06-28-181738 -->

- [x] **Shipped v4.26.0 (MINOR) — `refresh-metadata` (7th built-in) + a `memory-lint` `[stale-metadata]`
  advisory.** From a **cross-vendor field test**: Copilot / Gemini 3.1 Pro committed the v4.25.0 upgrade to
  mercury and, seeing `[review-overdue]`, **ran the review unprompted** — correctly using `archive-fact`
  (the over-archival guard even caught a premature archive of `adr-pattern-adopted` → it reverted). But it did
  Step 4 (archive) + Step 5 (sweep) and **skipped Step 2 (apply events) + Step 3 (re-tier)**, leaving stale
  `last_used`/`uses`/`tier` footers. **Third instance of one failure class** (truncation → `archive-fact`;
  never-fired review → `[review-overdue]`; now half-done ritual): multi-step agent rituals get partially
  executed. **The fix refines the judgment-vs-arithmetic boundary** — deciding *what to archive* is judgment
  (stays with the agent); recomputing metadata is **arithmetic** (REVIEW.md's "full rebuild," deterministic),
  safe to mechanize. **Built** `agent-skills/refresh-metadata/` (recompute footers from the reference log,
  read-into-memory-write-once; `core`/`superseded`/never-referenced untouched; clamps at `archive-candidate`,
  never archives) + `memory-lint` check (9) `[stale-metadata]` (stored tier ≠ recomputed). Both Python+Node at
  parity + mirror tests (memory-lint 33, refresh-metadata 5). **Dogfooded:** the new advisory flagged 11 stale
  footers on THIS repo (my own earlier reviews skipped re-tiering too — universal, not vendor-specific);
  `refresh-metadata` cleared all 11 → lint 0/0. Lockstep: skill + tests, memory-lint + tests, `REVIEW.md`
  (steps 2–3), `ENABLE.md` §5i (7 built-ins), `README`/`ADR`/continuity lists, adapters (8 skills → 48),
  `VERSION`→4.26.0, `CHANGELOG`, `UPGRADE` (row + rung). → serves: vision-agent-memory (the review's
  deterministic half is now mechanized; only judgment is left to the agent — across vendors)

- [x] **Shipped v4.25.0 (MINOR) — `archive-fact`, a deterministic safe archive-move helper (6th built-in).**
  From a **cross-vendor critique** (Copilot / Gemini 3.1 Pro, `review-scratch/critique.md`): "agent behaviors
  vary by vendor; relying on agent interpretation of `REVIEW.md` to safely mutate state is vulnerable to LLM
  regressions / file-editing precision — harden the memory-writing mechanism itself (a small CLI helper for
  safe writes)." Spot-on, and it names our **most-repeated bug**: the `open(f,"w").write(open(f).read()+…)`
  truncate-before-read trap (wiped a `version.md` stamp, then this repo's archive 50→6, once each;
  [[version-md-stamp-safe-write]]). v4.22.4 moved the safeguard personal-note → shared doc; this is doc →
  **tool**. **Built** `agent-skills/archive-fact/` (`provenance: agent-memory-builtin`): executes `REVIEW.md`
  step 4's move (extract block by footer id → append to quarter archive + INDEX → rewrite continuity
  *read-into-memory-then-write-once*). Python + Node at output parity + mirror tests; guards refuse a missing/
  already-archived id or a would-empty move (all-or-nothing); `--dry-run`. **Keeps the meaning/mechanics
  split** (same as `memory-lint`): the agent decides *what* to archive, the helper does the *move* — it never
  decides (`never-pick-a-winner`). Lockstep: skill + tests, `REVIEW.md` step 4 (preferred path), `ENABLE.md`
  §5i (6 built-ins), `README`/`ADR`/continuity built-in lists, adapters synced (7 skills → 42),
  `VERSION`→4.25.0, `CHANGELOG`, `UPGRADE` (row + rung). → serves: vision-agent-memory (faithful enablement —
  the riskiest state-mutation is now deterministic, not left to per-vendor agent diligence)

- [ ] **(backlog) Mode B upgrade automation — scope the mechanical steps only.** From the same Gemini critique
  (point 1): as the user base grows, the high-touch Mode B upgrade (re-sync specific files, run tools, stamp
  version) could be a source of drift/user error; "consider automating more of `ENABLE.md` Mode B via a
  script." **Deliberate tension:** the rungs are *semantic merges* (additive, preserve customizations, "re-sync
  `AGENTS.md` but never the root one") that must stay agent-judged — the chosen mitigation is **deterministic
  guardrails** (`check_version_manifest`, the v4.24.0 review-cadence advisory), not full automation. *If*
  revisited, script only the **mechanical** parts (file copies, version stamp — like `sync-adapters` did in
  v4.18.0) and leave the merges to the agent. Lower priority; logged so the critique isn't lost.

- [x] **Shipped v4.24.0 (MINOR) — decay-policy retune + a review-cadence/size advisory in `memory-lint`.**
  From a maintainer question (after the v4.23.2 review flagged continuity at 490 lines, still over the old
  300 cap): "recommend new parameters based on the mercury-composable learning." **Measured both enabled
  repos:** this tool (121 sessions, continuity 490 lines / 24 facts *right after a clean review*) and
  `mercury-composable` (61 sessions, **585 lines / 41 facts, 0 archived** — the cadence review had never
  fired in the field). **Four findings:** (1) `continuity_max_lines: 300` was permanently-red on both
  (alert fatigue) + conflates non-decaying structural sections with the decaying region; (2) no
  count-based trigger, though fact-count is the verbosity/velocity-independent signal; (3) **nothing
  enforced the review cadence** (mercury's smoking gun); (4) `verify_invariants_every: 20` = near-daily
  human re-confirms at burst velocity. **Shipped:** `memory-lint` advisory check (8) — `[review-overdue]`
  (reads the `last_review` stamp) + `[continuity-bloat]` (facts/lines), **both runtimes at parity + mirror
  tests (29 each)**; the keystone, since parameters alone can't fix a review that never runs. Retuned
  defaults: `continuity_max_facts: 30` (NEW, primary), `continuity_max_lines: 300→600`,
  `verify_invariants_every: 20→40`; `working/active/archive_window` + `review_every` unchanged (they work —
  bloat came from reviews not running). Lockstep: lint scripts+tests, `decay-policy.md` (template + this
  repo), `REVIEW.md`, `SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md` (root+template), `.agent/schema.md`, `VERSION`→4.24.0,
  `CHANGELOG`, `README` (table), `UPGRADE` (row + rung). Skill description unchanged → adapters untouched.
  → serves: vision-agent-memory (faithful, verifiable enablement — the layer's own health is enforced by a
  deterministic check, not left to agent diligence; the lesson came from a real product repo's drift)

- [x] **Shipped v4.23.1 (PATCH) — `last_harvest` marker for incremental harvests.** From a **cross-vendor
  test drive**: mercury-composable's own agent ran `harvest-knowledge` correctly (clean no-op — memory was
  already current; full protocol followed, good map-don't-mirror judgment) but had to **infer the harvest
  window** ("since enable") because nothing recorded *when the last harvest ran*. **Fix:** an optional
  `last_harvest: YYYY-MM-DD | through <session>` field in `continuity.md` Project State (with `last_review`
  / `last_invariant_check` — same family: "when did this periodic memory ritual last run"). **Decided
  against `.agent/version.md`** (the install manifest, version-gating — a different concern; like-with-like
  + separation-of-concerns favored Project State; maintainer agreed). `harvest-knowledge` now **reads** it
  to scope the next run and **stamps** it on completion (even a no-op — "docs checked through here"); the
  check-existing-first guard still prevents duplicates so a re-scan stays safe (`last_harvest` only
  *scopes*). Wired: `templates/.agent/schema.md` (field), `harvest-knowledge/SKILL.md` (read step 2 + stamp
  step 7), `VERSION`→4.23.1, `CHANGELOG`, `README` (table), `UPGRADE` (row + `4.23.0→4.23.1` rung). Skill
  *description* unchanged → adapters unchanged. → serves: vision-agent-memory (recurring harvest scopes
  incrementally; the marker mirrors the review's `last_review`) (`last-harvest-marker-v4231`).
  <!-- id: last-harvest-marker-v4231 | created: 2026-06-28 | last_used: 2026-06-28 | uses: 1 | tier: working | origin: 2026-06-28-041540 -->

- [x] **Shipped v4.23.0 (MINOR) — `harvest-knowledge` built-in skill (on-demand doc→memory harvest).**
  Surfaced when test-driving the mercury-composable upgrade: the curious harvest (v4.22.0, `ENABLE.md`
  Step 4b) seeds memory **once** at enable, but a *living* repo's docs keep evolving with no recurring way
  to fold new ADRs/design-specs/decision-log entries into memory. Maintainer's call: **leave the
  enable-time (re-)harvest a fresh-enable event (Mode A), and make the recurring need a skill.** Added a
  **5th built-in** `agent-skills/harvest-knowledge/` (`provenance: agent-memory-builtin`, no-code/agent-run):
  re-scan human-authored docs (same net as Step 4b) → distill durable facts into **neutral, shared**
  `memory/` **additively** (map-don't-mirror; check-existing-first so a re-run doesn't duplicate; conflicts
  → `Contradiction`; supersede a genuine replacement; budget-with-disclosure). **Explicitly not a vendor
  `/init`** (which does *code*-analysis → a *vendor* steering file, overwriting): this does
  knowledge-distillation → neutral memory, additive + repeatable — borrow /init's muscle, output stays
  neutral. Removed the inline Mode B re-harvest from the `4.21.0→4.22.0` upgrade rung (it's the skill's job
  now). Wired: `ENABLE.md` §5i (5 built-ins) + Step 8 list, `upgrades-additive` invariant + ADR-0005 (5
  built-ins), README (tree + version table), `CHANGELOG`, `UPGRADE` (row + `4.22.4→4.23.0` rung),
  `VERSION`→4.23.0; adapters synced (6 skills → 36; harvest-knowledge 6/6). `memory-lint` OK. → serves:
  vision-agent-memory (curiosity becomes a recurring capability for living repos, not a one-shot)
  (`harvest-knowledge-skill-v4230`).

- [x] **Shipped v4.22.4 (PATCH) — safe-write safeguard moved into the SHARED layer (`REVIEW.md`).**
  Maintainer correction: the safe-write lesson from the 2026-06-28 archive-truncation incident
  (`open(f,"w").write(open(f).read()+…)` wiped the archive 50→6) had only been recorded in my **personal**
  `~/.claude/` memory — per-machine, useless to teammates/other vendors. A safeguard protecting the review
  ritual belongs in the **committed shared layer** (the tool's own two-layer principle: personal prefs in
  `~/`, shared project knowledge in the repo). **Fix:** added two rules to `REVIEW.md` → **Safety** —
  (1) never truncate a memory file when scripting the move (append-mode `>>` / read-into-var for the
  archive/`INDEX.md`/`continuity.md`; never the truncate-before-read one-liner); (2) **run `memory-lint`
  after any scripted memory mutation** (it catches truncation — count drops, links dangle — and git-tracked
  files recover via `git checkout HEAD`). `REVIEW.md` is installed verbatim into every enabled repo, so all
  contributors + vendors now inherit it. (Kept the personal memory too — broadened it — but `REVIEW.md` is
  the authoritative team-facing safeguard.) Lockstep: `REVIEW.md`, `VERSION`→4.22.4, `CHANGELOG`, `README`
  (table +1/−1, drops 4.19.0), `UPGRADE` (row + `4.22.3→4.22.4` rung). → serves: vision-agent-memory
  (operational safety for the shared memory layer must itself be shared, not per-machine)
  (`safe-write-review-safety-v4224`).

- [x] **Shipped v4.22.3 (PATCH) — tightened the post-commit session window 2h → 30 min.** Maintainer
  observed the v4.22.1 window (2h) was too long: the real problem was follow-up stubs **minutes** apart,
  and 2h is long enough to wrongly conflate a *genuinely new* session that starts within 2h of the prior
  session's log (the hook would nudge "enrich the old log" for new work). **Fix:** default window → **30
  min** (spans a session's commit cadence incl. a short test/think gap; a new session after a >30-min pause
  still gets its own stub). The override env var changed unit to **minutes** —
  `AGENT_MEMORY_SESSION_WINDOW_MINUTES` (was `_HOURS`) — because BSD `date -v` rejects a fractional hour
  (`-v-0.5H`), so a sub-hour default needs integer minutes; both runtimes still supported (`date -v-30M` /
  `date -d "30 minutes ago"`). Re-validated (2m/25m → suppress; 45m/none → stub; custom override honored).
  Lockstep: `.githooks/post-commit`, `.githooks/README.md`, `docs/DESIGN-ritual-triggers.md`,
  `VERSION`→4.22.3, `CHANGELOG`, `README` (table +1/−1, drops 4.18.0), `UPGRADE` (row + `4.22.2→4.22.3` rung).

- [x] **Shipped v4.22.2 (PATCH) — lightweight mode: one log per *session*, not per *commit* (agent-side
  mirror of v4.22.1).** Maintainer accepted the recommendation flagged at v4.22.1: the same per-commit
  granularity the hook fix addressed also lived on the **agent-behavior** side — the lightweight-mode rule
  wrote a lite session log for *every* memory-neutral tracked-file change, so an agent making several small
  commits in one sitting produced a near-duplicate lite log per commit (clutter + decay session-count
  inflation). **Fix:** `AGENTS.md` (root + template) lightweight "lite log" tier now says — if a session log
  already exists for *this* working session, a later **memory-neutral** commit **enriches** that log (a
  one-line "also: …" note) rather than spawning another. The agent needs **no time-window** (unlike the
  hook): it *knows* it's the same working session. Explicitly preserves the existing model for
  **memory-relevant** work — distinct events each get their own full log (a multi-task conversation may
  still yield several), so this only coalesces *trivial* follow-ons. **Dogfooded immediately:** this very
  v4.22.2 work is memory-relevant → it got its **own** full log (this session), while the prior trivial doc
  commits would now coalesce. Wording-only — no shape/skill/hook change. Lockstep: `AGENTS.md` (root +
  template), `VERSION`→4.22.2, `CHANGELOG`, `README` (table +1/−1, drops 4.17.0), `UPGRADE` (row +

- [x] **Shipped v4.22.1 (PATCH) — post-commit auto-stub is per *session*, not per *commit*.** From
  **downstream `mercury-composable` feedback** (`review-scratch/feedback-2026-06-27-post-commit-session-stub.md`):
  the `.githooks/post-commit` auto-stub fired on **every** work commit because its only de-dup guard checked
  for an *untracked* stub — once the agent committed the session log, the next work commit found no waiting
  stub and wrote a fresh one (~6 near-identical lite logs/session, each with an extra `memory:` commit, and
  — since the decay model counts session files — `sessions_since_last_used` inflated so facts decayed ~N×
  fast; ironic given `memory-lint` exists to catch decay miscounts). **Fix:** the auto-stub now suppresses a
  new stub when a session log exists **within an active-session window** (default 2h; override
  `AGENT_MEMORY_SESSION_WINDOW_HOURS`), nudging the agent to **enrich that log** instead. Detected by the
  newest session **filename** timestamp — **immutable + clone-safe** (deliberately *not* `mtime`, which
  `git clone`/checkout resets to now → would wrongly suppress stubs for hours after a clone) — compared
  lexicographically to a window-ago stamp (`YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS` sorts chronologically). Subsumes the old
  untracked guard (a fresh stub has a recent filename) and covers the just-committed case; a genuinely new
  session (no log in window) still stubs (no silent gap). **Tested end-to-end** in a temp repo (S1 work →
  stub; S2 commit log; S3 work → *suppress*, not a 2nd stub) + the threshold/comparison in isolation (5m/90m
  → suppress; 3h/none → stub); BSD `date -v` with GNU `date -d` fallback. Lockstep: `.githooks/post-commit`,
  `.githooks/README.md`, `docs/DESIGN-ritual-triggers.md`, `VERSION`→4.22.1, `CHANGELOG`, `README` (table +1/−1),
  `UPGRADE` (row + `4.22.0→4.22.1` rung). First post-release patch under the *one version per release*
  policy (4.22.0 was pushed). → serves: vision-agent-memory (the decay model's integrity depends on a
  session-file count that tracks *sessions*, not commits) (`post-commit-per-session-v4221`).

- [x] **Applied a fresh-context critique (second-opinion → apply-critique) to the v4.22.0 work — 4 fixes,
  all folded into the unreleased v4.22.0 (no version bump, per the one-version-per-release policy).** A
  clean-context reviewer (different vendor, via `review-scratch/`) challenged the milestone; 3 of 4 items
  were real and applied, 1 validated-no-change: **(1) version consolidation — reviewer agreed, no change.
  (2) `MERGE.md` Tier 2 supersession was AI-discretionary** ("one side genuinely supersedes" = a disguised
  winner-pick risk) → **tightened**: a semantic clash is **always** keep-both + Contradiction *unless the
  human explicitly instructs* a supersession; the AI no longer judges "unambiguous." Reinforces
  `never-pick-a-winner`. **(3) `memory-lint` check 7 false-positive** — session logs legitimately *quote*
  conflict markers (a pasted diff/terminal block), so scanning `memory/**` would false-fail → **rescoped to
  live top-level `memory/*.md`** (continuity/instructions/vision/decay-policy/smoke-test); `sessions/` +
  `archive/` excluded. Both runtimes + 2 new tests each (now 22/22 at parity). **(4a) Review-block gotcha
  codified in `REVIEW.md` step 9** — don't list archived ids under `## Memory References` (re-arms the
  over-archival guard); they go in the `## Memory Review` block. **(4b) Hook-fatigue note** in
  `.githooks/README.md` — a feat/memory split trips the advisory on the code commit (expected/benign);
  prefer an atomic commit to avoid it. Gate: tests 22/22 both runtimes, `memory-lint` 0/0, parity OK. The
  fresh reviewer earned its keep (the check-7 false-positive was latent — it didn't fire only because this
  session's markers sit inline in backticks, not at line-start). **Cross-vendor re-validated 2026-06-27:**
  **Gemini 3.1 Pro** re-reviewed the *applied* fixes (read-only) and confirmed all four correctly address the
  critique with **no new issues** — closing the second-opinion → apply-critique loop **end-to-end across
  vendors** (Claude built + applied; Gemini critiqued + re-validated). Gemini also correctly followed
  **lightweight mode** (read-only → no session log) — incidental cross-vendor proof of that protocol too.

- [x] **Consolidated this session's four unreleased version bumps into a single v4.22.0 release + encoded
  the policy.** Maintainer observation: v4.22.0–v4.25.0 were all developed in one session with **nothing
  released to GitHub** (HEAD was v4.21.0) — four version numbers + four `UPGRADE.md` rungs for work no repo
  ever ran independently, inflating the ladder. **Fix:** `VERSION`→**4.22.0** (one MINOR over the released
  4.21.0; all four changes are additive); the four `UPGRADE.md` table rows + four rungs collapsed into one
  `4.21.0 → 4.22.0` row + rung that enumerates the four bundled features (a/b discovery+advisory, c
  merge-friendliness, d MERGE.md). **Policy encoded** in `UPGRADE.md` "Versioning model" → *"One version
  per release, not per feature"*: bump for a release event not per feature; keep a single **pending**
  version while unreleased; magnitude = largest change in the batch; released baseline = `VERSION` at
  `HEAD`, consolidate working-tree bumps beyond it before committing; per-feature detail lives in session
  logs + Open Threads, not extra version numbers. Memory handling: **session logs left immutable** (honest
  dev journal showing the 4.22–4.25 iteration); the four shipped threads kept as distinct facts but
  **headers relabeled** "Shipped in v4.22.0 (dev-iter 4.2X)"; `status` token → v4.22.0. → serves:

- [x] **Re-verify invariants (due at the 2026-06-27 review) — CONFIRMED by maintainer 2026-06-27,
  one by one.** All 5 core invariants (`target-repo-scope-only`, `never-delete-vendor-files`,
  `never-pick-a-winner`, `no-build-step-agent-run`, `upgrades-additive`) **and** the Vision
  (`vision-agent-memory`) still hold; none superseded. Recent work *reinforced* them — `never-pick-a-winner`
  is now the backbone of `MERGE.md` (v4.25.0); `no-build-step-agent-run` was invoked to reject a
  resolver-*engine* in favor of a markdown protocol; the multi-contributor Vision pillar was materially
  advanced (v4.24.0 + v4.25.0). **One wording fix** (substance-preserving, maintainer-approved): added
  `sync-adapters` to the `upgrades-additive` managed-built-ins example list (it became a tool-managed
  built-in in v4.18.0) — updated in both the invariant text and ADR-0005. The review only prompts;
  the human confirmed.

- [x] **Shipped in v4.22.0 (MINOR; dev-iter 4.25) — `MERGE.md` conflict-resolution protocol.** From a **GitHub Copilot
  review** of the v4.24.0 marker check (relayed by the maintainer): *don't let the LLM directly edit git
  conflict markers* — instead convert→classify→propose→validate→human-approve. **My assessment (honest,
  both ways):** Copilot's *principle* is right and maps onto an existing invariant (**`never-pick-a-winner`**)
  + existing primitives (Contradiction thread, supersession, provenance, `memory-lint` as the deterministic
  floor); but its framing over-reaches for this project — "never edit the markers" is unachievable (someone
  deletes them; the real rule is *never silently pick a winner*), most `continuity.md` conflicts are
  **mechanical** (the v4.24.0 union/take-later rules already handle them, no AI needed), and a
  convert/classify *engine* would cut against **`no-build-step-agent-run`**. **Chosen (maintainer): tiered
  markdown protocol**, not the full pipeline. **Done:** new installed root doc **`MERGE.md`** (read on
  demand, like `DECAY`/`REVIEW`/`SKILLS`): classify hunk → **Tier 1 mechanical** (additive → union/keep-both;
  scalar → take-later; deterministic) → **Tier 2 semantic clash** (AI **never** decides — preserve both +
  raise a `Contradiction` or an unambiguous **supersession**; `[ ]`→`[x]` race keeps checked; keep provenance)
  → **`memory-lint` gate** (reuses the v4.24.0 **check 7**, no linter change) → **human approves the merge
  commit** (never auto-commit). Wired: ENABLE Step 6 install + Step 8 verify + Notes + report + advisory
  footprint; `.agent/schema.md` "Concurrency & merge-friendliness" points to it; `UPGRADE.md` source-of-truth
  map + table row + `4.24.0→4.25.0` rung. `VERSION`→4.25.0. **Dogfood:** bumped this status line's version
  token only (no changelog prose) — exercising the v4.24.0 rule live. → serves: vision-agent-memory (a shared
  memory layer must survive concurrent multi-vendor use *without an AI silently losing a teammate's fact*).

- [x] **Shipped in v4.22.0 (MINOR; dev-iter 4.24) — `continuity.md` merge-friendliness.** From a **teammate-concurrency
  observation** (maintainer): session logs are conflict-free by construction (timestamped filenames),
  but `continuity.md` is a single shared file every teammate edits — and the **`status` line had become
  a ~20 KB single-line changelog**, the worst-possible git-merge surface (concurrent bumps ⇒ unresolvable
  conflict) and a `map-don't-duplicate` violation (it shadowed `UPGRADE.md`). Chosen scope (maintainer):
  **slim status + conventions + lint guard** (MINOR; *not* the MAJOR file-split — the status anti-pattern
  was ~90% of the pain). **Done:** (1) **`status` is now spec'd as a SHORT current-state line, not a
  changelog** — `.agent/schema.md` + both `AGENTS.md` (root + template) say don't accrete per-version
  history; history lives in session logs / the `UPGRADE.md` ladder. (2) New schema section **"Concurrency
  & merge-friendliness"**: one fact per line; append-only sections are independent facts; **conflict =
  keep-both (union)** by default; scalar bumps (`last_session`/`last_review`/version token) **take the
  later/higher**; only same-thread edits need a human. (3) **`memory-lint` check 7** — a leftover
  merge-conflict marker (`<<<<<<<`/`>>>>>>>`/diff3 `|||||||`) in any `memory/*.md` is an **ERROR**; a bare
  `=======` setext heading underline is **not** flagged (false-positive guard); added to both runtimes at
  parity with **5 mirror tests each** (`.py` + `.mjs` now 20/20). (4) **Dogfooded**: this repo's own status
  line slimmed **19,828 → 1,105 chars** (read-then-write, never truncate-first — `version-md-stamp-safe-write`).
  Lockstep: `.agent/schema.md`, `AGENTS.md` (root + template), `memory-lint` (scripts + tests + SKILL.md),
  `VERSION`→4.24.0, `UPGRADE.md` (table row + rung). **Note:** continuity is still 753 lines (> `continuity_max_lines`
  300) — that bloat is accumulated `[x] Shipped` Open Threads, the **review ritual's** job to archive (overdue);

- [x] **Shipped in v4.22.0 (MINOR; dev-iter 4.22) — curious knowledge harvest at enable.** From a **client-team
  enablement complaint** (another team, first run on their repo): discovery "was less curious than
  expected" — a canonical `docs/` folder was **skipped entirely**; when re-asked to recursively analyze
  it, the agent grabbed only the folder's **top-level** files (not subfolders); and a root-level markdown
  **kanban board + decision log** were missed. Root cause: `ENABLE.md` **Step 4** was a *classifier*
  (read a fixed manifest list; "Structure signals" looked only at **top-level** folder names) with **no
  knowledge-harvest** of the team's own docs. **Fix:** added **Step 4b — Harvest existing project
  knowledge (be curious)**: recursively descend every doc tree (`docs/`/`doc/`/`wiki/`/`rfcs/`/`adr/`/…,
  *all* subfolders) + sweep repo/module roots for human-authored knowledge markdown (decision logs, ADRs,
  kanban/roadmap/TODO, architecture/design, CONTRIBUTING, RFCs) by location and name; **read within a
  budget (~40 files/~400 KB, prioritized root→docs→recent) and disclose overflow as a
  `(knowledge-harvest)` Open Thread** so nothing vanishes silently; **distill, don't transcribe**
  (map-don't-mirror into instructions/Invariants/Open Threads/smoke-test/vision; conflicts → a
  `Contradiction:` thread). Wired into seeding 5a/5f/5g and a Step 8 verify check. **Operator-side only**
  (`ENABLE.md`) — **no installed-file shape change, no template re-sync, no adapter sync**; the
  `4.21.0→4.22.0` rung is a human-gated **optional re-harvest** to backfill a repo enabled by the older
  shallow scan (additive, never overwrites curated facts). Lockstep: `ENABLE.md` (Step 4 + 4b + 5a/5f/5g
  + Step 8), `VERSION`→4.22.0, `UPGRADE.md` (table rows for 4.21.0 *and* 4.22.0 — the 4.21.0 row was
  missing — plus the new rung). `memory-lint` OK (0 errors). Scoping (harvest breadth + bounding)
  confirmed with the maintainer before authoring. → serves: vision-agent-memory (a memory layer should
  inherit what the team already knows; curiosity is part of faithful enablement). Complaints = adoption
  signal.

- [x] **Shipped v4.20.0 (MINOR) — first-run init for fresh clones.** Dogfooding `~/sandbox/simple-proxy`
  with Copilot (fresh clone) exposed the gap: the **memory bootstrap self-initializes** (Copilot read
  AGENTS.md/memory on `start` — "start from AGENTS.md" was unnecessary), but a clone has the **gitignored
  skill adapters absent** and the **git hook unactivated** (`core.hooksPath` is local config; git can't
  auto-run committed hooks on clone). So the user had to run `sync skill adapters` **and** (easily missed)
  activate the hook — two manual steps, contra the zero-manual/untrained-user constraint. **Fix:**
  `.githooks/init.sh` (one idempotent command — regenerate adapters + `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`;
  not a git-hook name so never auto-run) + an `AGENTS.md` **self-init** note (the agent runs it on its first
  session, since Copilot already reads AGENTS.md on `start`). One agent step (or one human command) instead
  of two; CI stays the zero-config floor. Lockstep: `.githooks/init.sh` + `README.md`, `AGENTS.md` (root +
  template), `docs/DESIGN-ritual-triggers.md`, `UPGRADE.md` (rung + table), `README`, `CHANGELOG`,
  `VERSION`→4.20.0. Dogfooded: init.sh on the tool; pushed to both repos. **Strong validation in the same
  dogfood:** Copilot praised the separation of concerns, idempotent sync, "executable documentation", and
  resiliency — "highly robust, deterministic, and easy to reason about." → serves: vision-agent-memory
  (untrained-user adoption — a fresh clone self-initializes with no manual ritual)
  **v4.20.1 follow-up (fresh-clone re-test, 2026-06-24):** self-init worked for **Claude Code** (it
  checked `core.hooksPath`, ran `init.sh` proactively → hook active + adapters synced) but **NOT Copilot
  CLI** (its `start` front-loads `copilot-instructions.md` + summarizes; skipped the AGENTS.md self-init →
  hook inactive + adapters absent). The v4.20.0 "Copilot reads AGENTS.md on start" assumption was
  optimistic. **Fix (4.20.1):** folded the first-run init into the **top of `copilot-instructions.md`**
  (the file Copilot reliably front-loads). Honest: still prompt-adherence (non-deterministic) —
  `bash .githooks/init.sh` is the one-command fallback, CI the floor.
  **VALIDATED 2026-06-24 (fresh re-clone, Copilot CLI / Gemini):** the 4.20.1 fix works — Copilot
  **self-inited**, running `.githooks/init.sh` as its first step ("explicit and straightforward") before
  summarizing. So a fresh clone now self-initializes with **zero manual steps on both Claude and Copilot**
  — the untrained-user / fresh-clone goal is met cross-vendor. Closes the Copilot arc (v4.17.0 → 4.20.1).

### Evolving long-term memory layer (v3.0.0) — BUILT 2026-06-13
- [ ] **Dogfood backfill (optional):** this repo adopted the layer — added
  Architectural Invariants (core), `memory/decay-policy.md`, `memory/archive/INDEX.md`,
  `last_review`, and Memory References in session logs going forward. Legacy facts in
  What's Been Built / Key Decisions are grandfathered as `active` (no metadata footers
  yet); backfill them with ids/metadata if/when desired (or let the first review do it).
- [ ] Optionally update `examples/` to mention the mercury upgrade as a real Mode B
  upgrade fixture (analogous to rust-event-bus being a real Mode A).

### Next major iteration — Vision → Blueprint → Design → Implementation (VBDI) lifecycle
> Set 2026-06-14. The vNext backlog (P1–P5) is complete; this is the next headline direction.
> Paused at the framing stage by mutual agreement — to be tackled methodically next.

- [ ] **Build a VBDI lifecycle layer** — *forward*-looking intent traceability to complement
  the *backward*-looking memory layer. Mission: empower AI to deliver **predictable
  innovation** with human partnership — a deterministic *process* + an enforceable *trace*
  from intent → delivery, with a human gate at each altitude change (Vision → Blueprint →
  Design → Implementation). "Predictable" = the process/trace, not the ideas. Reuses
  existing primitives: id/origin/supersedes linkage (trace across altitudes), §10
  contradiction-check (drift detection: impl vs design, design vs blueprint vs vision),
  §9 supersession (intent changes ripple down), the human-gate pattern
  (never-pick-a-winner / invariant-verify prompt), and the smoke test (acceptance vs
  design criteria). Stays no-code/markdown + deterministic. **Plan:** dogfood it — write
  the Vision (human's to set), then `DESIGN-vbdi-lifecycle.md` (sibling to
  `DESIGN-evolving-memory.md`), settle forks via structured decisions, build on the
  version ladder. **Hard parts:** drift across altitudes needs real structure (not
  hand-waving); keep gates lightweight (Open-Thread-like, not Jira); the trace must be
  enforceable (grep/review), not just documented. Validated motivation: the Node→Rust
  rewrite delivered deterministically with no drift — VBDI generalizes that to creation.

### Shipped — v4.1.0: cross-vendor skills layer (2026-06-15)

> _v4.2.0 ("sync skill adapters", `sync-adapters-v420`) archived faded → `archive/2026-Q2.md` (2026-06-18 review)._

> Reactivated from `archive/2026-Q2.md` 2026-06-18 — the 2026-06-18-051933 review (GitHub Copilot)
> swept these while they were still referenced in the window (low sslu); restored to `active`.

### Blueprint — gaps from Current State (v4.10.0) to the Vision  (serves: vision-agent-memory)
> Derived 2026-06-15 from `memory/vision.md` (maintainer-confirmed). Typed Open Threads
> `(blueprint)`: each is a Vision↔reality gap that closes when delivered. The *backward*
> memory layer is not here — it's done; every gap is *forward*. These operationalize the
> `vbdi-lifecycle-direction` thread above. First real VBDI loop, dogfooded on the tool itself.

  memory design is already **process-neutral** and survives an overlay (`DECAY.md` §12 /

  (2026-06-13) in favor of the markdown-native evolving-memory layer above. Not
  deleted — revisit if the markdown layer hits limits. Original open questions:
  replace vs supplement markdown; entity/relation schema; agent interaction

### Pre-existing
- [ ] Test migration on a real repo with Cursor + Aider footprint
- [ ] Test migration on a Claude Code repo with .claude/projects/*.jsonl
- [ ] Test Continue.dev session JSON migration end-to-end
- [ ] Add example for migrating a Continue.dev project
- [ ] Consider a `DISABLE.md` protocol for cleanly removing AI memory
- [x] **Publish to GitHub — DONE 2026-06-18.** Migrated GitLab → **public GitHub** at
  `git@github.com:acn-ericlaw/agent-memory.git` (Apache-2.0; **release-candidate** status; full
  73-commit history mirrored). The repo + working dir are now **`agent-memory`** (dropped the
  `-tool` suffix — the canonical name everywhere already). GitLab
  (`git@gitlab.com:ericclaw/agent-memory-tool.git`) is being **retired**. The
  `no-company-references-until-publication-approved` gate is satisfied — company protocol followed,
  maintainer approved public publication. **`origin` is now GitHub; assume GitHub for git ops.**
- [ ] **Remaining: migrate to enterprise GitHub** for the official repo (one more hop after this
  public-GitHub staging step). (Set 2026-06-18.)
- [ ] Keep root `CLAUDE.md` architecture section in sync when file shapes or
  vendor support change (also touches `templates/`, `MIGRATE.md`, `README.md`,
  `examples/`)

## User Preferences

- Never expose the user's absolute home path (`/Users/<name>/…`) in file content —
  use `~`-relative paths. (Stated 2026-06-12; now enforced in ENABLE.md Step 5b +
  schema `repo:` guidance.)
